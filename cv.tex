\section{Experience}
\cventry{2021--}{Technical Lead}{nazaríes intelligenia}{Granada}{}{I combine my role as a developer in more complex
projects with a managerial role. I'm currently working on a Ruby on Rails open-source platform for citizen participation
implemented by many public organizations. I'm also the main responsible for the Software Department in the IoT platform,
so I manage a small team and I take care of every solution we develop is taking us in the right direction.}
\cventry{2017-2021}{Software Engineer}{nazaríes intelligenia}{Granada}{}{Starting as a junior, after a successful stage
during my internship, I developed myself until being considered a senior and one of the key pieces in the team. I have
been a developer on several projects with both national and international clients. Although the main project I've been
working on is an IoT platform with a tech stack based on Ruby on Rails, I've also been working on other projects with
Ruby on Rails and other diverse technologies: such as a desktop application with C++ to control UAVs, a pure back-end
project with Spring, various hybrid mobile applications using Ionic, a customized e-commerce platform with PHP or an
important telemedicine platform with PHP too.}

Science I studied. I started learning and working with Ruby on Rails.}
\cventry{2016-2017}{Scholarship Assistant}{Department of Lenguajes y Sistemas Informáticos}{Granada}{}{Working on an
